about=Generating XYZ tiles (MBTiles) only around the features of a given vector layer allows to save disk space and time, instead of generating the tiles for the entire area covered by the bounding box of the layer. The final result is equivalent to running the "Generate XYZ tiles (MBTiles)" over each one of the features, producing different mbtiles and then merging them all.
